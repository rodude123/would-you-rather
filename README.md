# Would you rather project

## Implementation

This is my implementation of the would you rather project. I have incorporated redux, components and react router. It features the ability to login, answer questions, ask questions and see a leaderboard.

## Installation and Running

To get this up and running clone the project or download the zip and extract it. 

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` then `yarn start` or `npm start`. It should open your favourite browser with the app.

## Contributing
